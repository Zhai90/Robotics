# Small Update

{@embed:https://youtu.be/R_6jeSqG4ao}

Oh, and here's the solution for Resolve not launching correctly I mentioned about sharing in the video:

~~~sh showLineNumbers
# in your .zshrc or .bashrc
# remember, this was tested on Arch Linux, so it might not work on macos or other distros
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libglib-2.0.so:/usr/lib64/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0:/usr/lib64/libgio-2.0.so:/usr/lib64/libgmodule-2.0.so
~~~

then open Davinci Resolve with
~~~sh
$ /opt/resolve/bin/resolve
~~~

you can also just alias it to something that's less of a mouthful:

~~~sh
# .zshrc/.bashrc
alias resolve="/opt/resolve/bin/resolve"
~~~

there's also the two-in-one combo if you want to save lines in your file:

~~~sh
# .zshrc/.bashrc
alias resolve="LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libglib-2.0.so:/usr/lib64/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0:/usr/lib64/libgio-2.0.so:/usr/lib64/libgmodule-2.0.so /opt/resolve/bin/resolve"
~~~

# Shenanigans aside, hi!

Hey, it's been a while (practically 8 months now), and a bunch of things have changed. First things first, the site has been updated with new information, which is cool!

Second things second, I've sort of started taking coding to a more serious level, with my end goal to participate in the IOI (International Olympiad of Informatics) through either USACO (USA Computing Olympiads) or OCI (Olimpiada Chilena de Informatica).

To achieve this goal, I've decided to start utilizing the time during the coding class at my school to instead study more advanced topics. Thanks Mr. Scott for helping me achieve my dream!

My first step towards this plan is to complete the CS50x course from Harvard to fill in on any concepts that I might've overlooked when self-teaching myself coding.

So far, I've gone through Week 0 and Week 1's lectures, sections, shorts, and problem sets. Here are the scores I've gotten on my submissions!

![Scores I've gotten with check50 which make sures the code passes the tests and style50, making sure it follows style conventions](https://i.imgur.com/g6O0uU4.png)

check50 makes sure your code passes the predetermined test cases your code is designed to go through, and style50 makes sure your code follows the style conventions. So far, I've studied from Scratch, a visual programming language, to C, one of the first languages to ever language, ever.

Scratch looks nice and colorful, like this:

![Scratch code](https://i.imgur.com/xN6f4P4.png)

[Here's the game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1054360272/) that the code above belongs to, but be warned; it's not that good.

C looks more cryptic, yet familiar (but that's if you've read my [Coding In Arduino blog post](https://zhai-r.netlify.app/blogs/2)), like this:

~~~c showLineNumbers
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("hello, world!");
}
~~~

I will keep documenting my journey!

# Day 2

Actually, it's more like, uhhh, day 7, but it's the 2nd day I'm writing here. In the near future, I might write a blog about either Neovim or Linux ([GNU/Linux](https://www.lignux.org)), as it's been about half a year since I've been using Linux, and for Neovim I started using it a couple months before actually diving into Linux.

This is how my Arch Linux w/ KDE Plasma on Wayland looks like:

![A screenshot of my desktop environment.](https://i.imgur.com/ioCIO4e.png)

Quick ad, [here's](https://github.com/Zhai90/zvim) my Neovim configuration if you're interested.

Anyway, back on topic, I've actually been working a lot on CS50 and also a bunch of other side projects I'll mention later.

I'm now on Week 4: Memory, and it's been really cool listening to David Malan teach this course.

I'm also working with a friend at teaching people at my school's coding club, which is always nice!

Back to CS50, everything went perfectly, until I stumbled upon the Tideman problem from Week 3, which bugged me for 3 days straight.

I can't post the answer as it'd be a violation of academic integrity set by the CS50 course staff, but I can give you some hints!

Firstly, don't worry about the things you learned in that week, you'll only apply 2 of all the concepts you've learned, and 1 of those concepts is even optional, as it can be replaced by a for loop, *wink wink*.

Focus on one thing at a time, and don't feel pressured to do it all by yourself. Ask a friend for hints (NOT the answer) or the DDB, CS50's duck debugger at [CS50's own AI!](https://cs50.ai), which can be really helpful, and yes, it is allowed.

I've also been working on another project which is Explora, a chilean program, and the first robotics festival here @ Chile, specifically Lo Barnechea in Santiago, so stay tuned for updates on that. It won't be in much detail, but I'll show progress as things advance.

# Day 3

*More like day 13.*

I've worked a little bit on the website for the robotics festival. [Here's the repo](https://github.com/Zhai90/festival-robotica) on Github with the current work in progress website.

Time has been lacking lately and so I haven't worked that much on the CS50 things, but I have completed the first and almost the second problem sets of week 4; volume, and the harder version of filter. So far in filter, I'm only missing the edge detection function, so hopefully I'll get that done soon.

I've also been trying to add a copy code button to the code snippets present throughout the Coding with Arduino blog and this one, but the way the blogs system was implemented here didn't allow for changes like that as I'm relying on an external library/plugin to allow Markdown to recognize "patterns" that aren't supported in normal Markdown. 

And that got me thinking...

I coded this website over a year ago, before I knew how to use Typescript (this website is fully written in Javascript), before I knew about NextJS, and before I knew how to write *good* code. You could argue that I still don't know how to write good code, but I guarantee you that it's much better than this mess of a codebase, just look at the [source code](https://github.com/Zhai90/robotics-portfolio) of this website.

Let's take a look...:

* Horrible commit messages:

![oh my god](https://i.imgur.com/1wH2s8s.png)

* Horrible implementations:

  *this is the code for the searching algorithm, it's not bad but does that mean it's good?*
![oh my god x2](https://i.imgur.com/pxSpO8G.png)

  And if you don't know why that's bad, it's searching the entirety of the data of every blog, which makes it inaccurate. If I now say soldering, that's going to make this blog appear when you search soldering in the search bar even though this blog has nothing to do with it. 

  And it's completely re-creating the array of blogs data

  And also it's slow.

  Speaking of which, I shouldn't have even used arrays; the current implementation makes it so that all blog data is downloaded the first time you enter this website, even if you haven't even gone to any of the blogs yet.

* Horrible comments (or the lack thereof at all):

  *I can't be bothered to take another screenshot and upload it into Imgur*
  ~~~jsx {3} showLineNumbers
    // ...

    // what in tghe heck is this 
    function updateFilter(event) {
        setFilter((prevFilter) => ({
            ...prevFilter,
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        }));
    // ...
    }
  ~~~

But then again, it was a learning process so maybe it was necessary after all.

Going back to Markdown stuff, I was thinking of trying out using MDX for Markdown, but that would require a complete rewrite of how Markdown is rendered in the website and how YouTube videos and images and lists and all that are displayed, which would take longer than I can stand.

So it's going to stay like this :)

# Day 4

*it's been a week and a half since day 3...*

I've sort of stopped worrying about this website and have been more focused on the website for the robotics event, which is now a "junta" (get-together) instead of a festival. 

I've also put the CS50 course on pause as school is starting to demand more and more attention and time from me so I'll have to push it back to when I have a lot of free time.

Here are some progress screenshots of the robotics website!:

Here's the first iteration:


![boring ahh website](https://i.imgur.com/OJlZula.png)

Actually, that's a lie, the first iteration looks more like this

![nextjs boilerplate template](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F1aHobcZ8H6WY48u5CMXlOe%2F560e6e93ced2d1af6d65cc6e7fbc914d%2FCleanShot_2024-01-12_at_09.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_D4zFxLzzEyG4uVAuhYJLb6dbLjK6)

But that's the template you automatically get when you set up a NextJS app, so it doesn't really count.

As you can see, the first iteration that I consider is pretty barebones, it has a title, which is now outdated, has a messy one-tenth-done navigation menu, and it just looks like a 4 year old made it. Not saying that 4 year olds can't code, but even if they were able, I think that is how it would look like.

In the future, once I have time and am done with other projects, I'll make an actual real production-ready blog website also functioning as a portfolio for my projects, I may make a guide on how to get started on creating applications like these!

Anyway, that version is just the planning phase - I still didn't know what to actually put on the website, nor how it would look like, that's also why there's a blue box around the text - it's for seeing the boundaries/border of the text.

After that, this was the website

![still boring ahh website](https://i.imgur.com/Q6KKJ56.png)

The blue box is gone, and now the navigation menu is a little bit better, nothing much to see here.

The next one is a big upgrade from the previous iterations.

![not so boring ahh website](https://i.imgur.com/rV5SLRD.png)

I started using an UI library called [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/), which is where the lights and grid background come from. The avatar icon in the navigation bar comes from another UI library called [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Both are really helpful and I would 100% recommend them if you have a tight deadline but still want to create a stunning website.

After this iteration, I started experimenting with different types of background that would maybe be more eye-catching. Take a look:

![took me so long to make this gif](https://i.imgur.com/XcLHhDd.gif)

The background now looks way cooler, however I found out that when on the website, the CPU usage on my Macbook M1 Pro would rocket up to 40%, which is absolutely nuts for a website effect, so I decided to remove it. Which was a good decision, because my battery went from 80% to 20% in an hour while I was experimenting with that background effect.

It's also from Aceternity, and it works by drawing lines on the screen, and making little gradients follow the same path as the lines. I don't know why that would kill your battery, but oh well.

Oh, and at this point I've also started using [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), an animation library that makes animating times easier.

Yeah, and so I removed that background, and experimented with some other stuff:

![updated version](https://i.imgur.com/VIeWdwp.gif)

It's back to being that grid, but it has a cool effect when you over your mouse over it. You probably can't see it very well because of the crappy gif quality, but if you really focus on it, you can see it!

And that leads to this design, which is the current one:

![last design](https://i.imgur.com/IIeBgyh.gif)

And that's all! I'll be adding more progress as time goes on.

See you next time!

# Day 5?? I think??

*more like month 2*

Hey! It's been a while. It's dieciocho break at the time of me writing this, Thursday in fact, and I've just spent 5 days doing absolutely nothing but going out with my family and messing around with my computer.

For some context, I've been messing around with this new fancy toy of mine called [NixOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS) and it's awesome! In summary, it's a Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager, which basically allows your entire system to be defined in a single configuration text file, and it's really awesome, even though it is absolutely painful to learn, and the documentation is just not there.

Here's how my setup looks like so far:

![A screenshot with Neovim open in front of the browser](https://i.imgur.com/3tBW1h9.png)

I don't think you'll be interested in the nitty gritty of things, let alone fine details of this, so I won't go into it - but if you are, feel free to ask me!

Other than messing with my computer and bricking it every minute, I've also been working on the robotics event website for the event, which from now on, I'll refer to as the *robotics* website. I'll also refer to the website you're currently on reading this as the *blogs* website.

I sort of skipped over a ton of details on the last update about it, the one that showed how to website became how it is (or how it was at that point), so I'll go a bit more in depth now.

When I how the website improved, it sort of looked like as if the whole thing took 5 minutes and I never struggled at all, when that's not the case.

Firstly, to even get the progress screenshots, I had to go back to older versions of the "release" of the website in order to actually take the screenshots, as I had been so focused on getting the website done that I never really bothered doing the screenshots in place. I've in fact still not learned my lesson, but hopefully from now on I'll remember to go around taking screenshots during development.

Luckily for me, getting those screenshots was pretty intuitive. Here's how it looks like:

![Vercel's deployment tab in a project](https://i.imgur.com/bBB8eWg.png)

I just click on one of those "updates" and it'll give me a link showing how the website looked at that point. The website is named [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and it's a platform that allows you to host your website in a "serverless" way, which in simple terms means you don't really have to pay for it (oversimplification warning). It's also the company behind [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), which is the framework, or library I build my websites with nowadays. You can imagine NextJS as something like p5, but instead of just giving you commands to draw things, it provides a special type of file with a different syntax you get to write your code with.

Anyway, back on the topic, I was talking about how the process of building the robotics website looked effortless and quick, when it wasn't. For example, if you go up and look at the avatar icon here

![Iteration number 4](https://i.imgur.com/rV5SLRD.png)

that took me a long time to get right, because when you click it, a dropdown menu actually pops down, and when you hover over it, a little tooltip appears. It looked something like this:

![Avatar with the effects](https://i.imgur.com/3AkBpnh.gif)

And even though that looks dead simple to make, it wasn't. I was going left and right trying to make it work, because since I was using pre-made components to achieve this, I had to find a way to make them work when they weren't exactly made to work together. That alone took me half an hour to do.

The cool looking background with the lights also took me a long time. If I had to guess, I probably spent at least around 2 hours just trying to make it look good, trying out different combinations of that with other things, like just one beam of light, or maybe making the background change color a little bit, etc.

From these experiences you can probably now see that things take time and mistakes to make stuff look good. Lots of time. And even more mistakes. And even more of both to not only make stuff look good, but also to be functional.

Jumping over to present time, the biggest update to the robotics website is that now you can actually log in with your Google and Github accounts. Here, take a look:

{@embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxdkMQMGqeE}

*I know the video quality is horrible.*

You can see the accounts system in place for the website. You're supposed to be able to sign up/sign in, create your team, and be on your way to participate in the event!

Very cool and fancy page transition animation aside, you can probably guess that a lot of things in the background are happening for this to work correctly, and you would be right!

This took me, *counts fingers*, at least 3 seconds minimum to make, and a lot of ChatGPT and Gemini was involved - not because I couldn't code or anything - but because I kept getting this one error that had absolutely no information online on how I would go around fixing it. I ended up making it go away, so there's nothing to worry about until the unit tests come.

This is made using [AuthJS](https://authjs.dev/), which does all the dirty work for me and gives me abstractions (building blocks) to manufacture my own authentication (login) system! It's awesome, and it's really fun to set up.

On the way to achieving what you saw in the video, there were a crap ton of things I had to go through. Firstly, the navigation bar now looks different. It actually looks really fun now, watch:

![Navigation bar, heavily modified from Aceternity's navigation menu](https://i.imgur.com/HfBJNJi.gif)

You have no idea how annoying it was to get the thing to look like this. At first, the dropdown menus were unaligned, which started to bother me, a *LOT*, so it was back and forth hitting my head against my monitor trying to find out why in the world it wasn't aligning when I was already doing everything I could to fix it. At the end, I ended up going with a very "hacky" approach, which was to just set the maximum distance from the navbar to a fixed value, which may not seem like a bad solution, but something tells me that that implementation is definitely going to break something in the future.

Making the sign out functionality was also something out of the scope of what I knew how to do. I ended up asking ChatGPT, who told me to create an API route that when access made a POST request to sign out. In simpler terms, when you click the button, it sends you to a part of the website which detects that you're there, signs you out, and then redirects you to the home page.

There was also a lot of trying to figure out edge cases where the user for example logged in but didn't get redirected, or when the user gets stuck at the signing out page, etc.

Wow, lots of backs and forths everywhere.

From here on I'll take a break from working on the robotics website and focus more on both CS50 and the AP Compsci exam.

I forgot to mention that, I've been interested in taking the AP Exam for computer science, and it's really convenient since it's all about topics I've already known about for, *counts fingers*, the past few years, so I just need to improve my Java skills - which is what the AP Compsci exam is going to be in - so yeah. It shouldn't even be that bad since I've worked with Java quite a bit before when making Minecraft server plugins, so yeah!

I think I'll cut it off here. Thank you for reading, and I'll see you next time! Cheers!

# Day 6

I won't make the joke again.

Anyway, it's been exactly 1 week since the last update here. I'll be honest, I've not gotten much done. I've been stressing about other things in life such as school, and also my birthday is coming up on the 29th of September, which sounds fun and all but it sort of scares me that I will be having less and less time to work on what I want to work on.

I'll be turning 16, and this website will be turning one. Actually, this website already turned one a bit ago now. The website's official birthday is the 10th of August, 2023. At least that's the date of the earliest commit I made to the Github repository of this website, so I guess it would be accurate to say that it's its birthday too.

I've been working on the filter problem set of week 4 of CS50, and I've finally completed it after putting off again and again because of the edge detection function. The answer is really straightforward. You can pretty much copy the algorithm you used for the blur and do the rest. Brian Yu explains it really well in the walkthrough, so if you don't understand what the page means by "kernels" or "gx and gy", you should watch the walkthrough, and you shouldn't feel guilty about it either.

Now that I'm done with that, I can move onto the recover problem set, which I feel like is way easier (as long as you understand how to deal with the bytes you read from a file, that is), and also more fun, that could be just me though.

# ~~Day~~ Update 7

It's been 3 months since I've last written here. I've been occupied with another things in life, and haven't really remembered to update my progress here.

Here's a quick rundown of the things I've done:
  - I've decided to pretty much scrap the robotics website due to the lack of maintenance making the code harder to improve upon and extend. I'll attach a video later on.
  - I've finished week 5 of CS50, and I'm halfway through the Speller problemset.
  - Lastly, I've been messing around with Go and C++, alongside WebAssembly and Rust.

Firstly, the decision to recode the robotics website was purely because I noticed that I was too excited to make the website look cool that it wasn't really functional. It only worked on certain screen dimensions, and it had absolutely 0 mobile support, meaning that it looked horrible. Imagine the website, and putting it between two horizontal hydraulic presses.

I decided to stop working on that one and have instead made a new website applying new design choices now that I feel much more skilled in terms of web development. Here's a rough look:

{@embed:https://youtu.be/pmJ6BIVdeQA}

It really isn't a lot, and if you think that I'm making the same mistake of focusing too much on looks and too little on functionality, don't worry, I only spent 2 hours on that and the rest is just adding content and implementing some other functionality that won't take too long, such as the login system (which I already have the code for) and internalization (i18n) which basically means adding multiple language support.

As for CS50, I haven't had a lot of time nor motivation to watch the lectures, I have however been working on and off on the pending problemsets. After I've finished these, I'll then work on week 6, which is Python. For the first problem, "inheritance", it's not complicated, so if you're working on that one and cand't figure out what's going wrong, start over and don't overthink it.

In regards to Go, I wanted to learn it because it's fast, sort of like the "C of the 21st century", and pretty easy to learn. I ended up making an HTTP API server with Go following a tutorial and it was pretty fun, however, the structuring of Go projects is really confusing for me so that's the only project I ended up making with Go.

After Go, I tried C++. It's similar to C (I wonder why), it's as fast as C, it's modern, has OOP, and is widely used. I did some LeetCode with C++, and it was in general really fun. I even did the Two Sum exercise making a solution that was actually O(n) by using hashmaps!

LeetCode aside, I then messed around with WebAssembly to make a truly multi-purpose website with NextJS and C++ for the backend for fast calculations for certain tools. The documentation in regards to C++ in WebAssembly is a little bit confusing; using gcc or clang for WASM is weird, and so you have to use a third-party compiler called Emscripten, which doesn't have a lot of documentation online.

I ended up getting it to work, having exported a WASM project that had the .wasm binary, and the Javascript wrapper files that interacted with the binary. However, the issue that made me switch over to using Rust was that the automatically generated Javascript code from emcc (Emscripten's C compiler) kept throwing an error that had little to no appearance online.

As C++ and Emscripten were giving me issues, I then tried using Rust with wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack, which do seem to work but I still need to stitch it together to work with NextJS.

It may seem like I've not done a lot these 3 months, and you might be right. I went to Brazil for an international STEM competition which my team ended up winning, and then participated in other national events. Other than that, I've not done a lot :)

Next update I'll report back on how the WebAssembly implementation with NextJS is working, and I'll also make a guide on it so that others can finally not have to deal with StackOverflow threads from 2014 and no positively upvoted answers.

Peace!
